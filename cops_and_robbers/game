cops and robbers:

There are two kinds of players in a grid: cops and robbers, while each
game must have at least one cop and one robber. Every turn, only one player can move, and players are able to move up, down, left and right, but cannot
move out of the border. As soon as the cops catch the robber, the robbers win,and as soon as the maximum number of turns is over, the robbers win.
