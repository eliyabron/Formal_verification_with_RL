Catch the cheese:

n a grid there is one player and two different kinds of squares- a hole or the
cheese. The player P must move to catch the cheese C without falling into the
pit O. The player gets one point of each cheese he finds and loses if he falls into
the pit. The game ends if the user gets either 5 points or falls into the hole.
